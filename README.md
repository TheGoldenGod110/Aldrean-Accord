# Aldrean-Accord
Aldrean Accord is an alternate earth/history mod for Hearts of Iron IV that poses the question: What would happen in a completely geographically different world with "similar" history/technology. IE, world events, cultures, religions, countries, people, and the world itself are all fictional. However, technology and cultures are somewhat recognizable and based on the real world.

Currently, we (mostly myself) are a very small dev team. Though, we (I) may be looking for more devs in the future.

A lot of credit to kaiserreich and various GFX repositories for the GFX. You can use any GFX made by us all you want - none of us are lawyers, I promise.

# Aldrean-Accord
Aldrean Accord is an alternate earth/history mod for Hearts of Iron IV that poses the question: What would happen in a completely geographically different world with "similar" history/technology. IE, world events, cultures, religions, countries, people, and the world itself are all fictional. However, technology and cultures are somewhat recognizable and based on the real world.

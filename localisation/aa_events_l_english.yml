 ###Hadernish News Events
 
 aanews.11.t:0 "Johan Horner Elected Chairman in Hadernland" 
 aanews.11.d:0 "In a the wake of long-time Chairman Henrik Karlan declaring his resignation, this year's Federal Congressional elections proved harder fought than ever before. Once the votes were counted, the syndicalist HAK came out on top; with Johan Horner - a libertarian syndicalist - taking the chair.\n\nThis is no doubt a change of pace in Hadernish politics. The new Chairman and his running mate Leah Foster, a women's rights activist in the congress, ran on a platform of radical, progressive change. It remains to be seen just how far his reforms will ultimately go."

 aanews.12.c:0 "It's all a sham anyways!"

Her iron-fisted reputation and advocacy of total state-control of the conomy has earned her some harsh criticism, but it remains to be seen if congress can temper her."

 aanews.13.b:0 "Interesting."
 aanews.13.c:0 "It's all a sham anyways!"

Once northern provincial governments refused to acknowledge the new voulgerist government and arrest Horner, they then closed their borders to non-syndicalist soldiers and militia.\nAs Bowker gave Horner's syndicalist government 30 days to surrender, it now seems that civil war is unavoidable."
 aanews.15.a:0 "Horner will never surrender!"
 aanews.15.b:0 "Terrible."
 aanews.15.c:0 "Interesting."
 
 aanews.16.t:0 "The Hadernish Civil War" ###Removed###
 aanews.16.d:0 "With the deadline to surrender power to Bowker passing with no response from Horner, it is clear what his reply is. So, Bowker delivered an ultimatum to the Union of Hadernland, threatening destruction and executions should they refuse to concede power. Horner, having barricaded the northern cities, met the threat head on by readying the militias to defend what he called 'the last territory of free workers in Hadernland.'

After Foster pulled the injured congresswomen beside her to cover, she took her gun and defended them. After being shot in the shoulder and collapsing, the police and army arrived to pull them to safety.\nMany suspect the primary target was Leah Foster herself, as she was the highest ranking member of the motorcade. The police managed to detain one of the gunmen, and will be questioning him within the coming days, trying to determine who planned the attack."

After Foster pulled the injured congresswomen beside her to cover, she took her gun and fought dearly for her life. Collapsing after taking a bullet, the police and army arrived to pull them to safety.\nMany suspect the primary target was Foster herself, as she was the highest ranking member of the motorcade.

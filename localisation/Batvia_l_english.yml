 ###Events
 
 batvia.1.t:0 "Major Socialist Rally"
 batvia.1.d:0 "Yesterday, the Batvian Communist Party held another major rally in Daverni, with some 15 thousand attending the event. Among the speakers was the party leader, Stona Donelo, who, at the end of his speech, announced his candidacy for president, to an uproar of applause.\n\nThe political aftershock of the event has some in congress scrambling to halt the growth of the Batvian left. Though, with the economic downturn in recent years, the rise of extremists has become recognized by some as an inevitability, as the recession has created the right conditions for the explosive growth of the BCP.\n\nBoth moderate and far right papers alike have denounced the communist movement and their leader, though it is seeming more and more likely that Donelo's movement will be able to punch above its weight come september."
 batvia.1.a:0 "We shall see."
 
 batvia.2.t:0 "1936 Presidential Election"
 batvia.2.d:0 "Amidst a highly divided political landscape, the votes for the presidential election are coming in..."
 batvia.2.a:0 "Limon Oxo is reelected."
 batvia.2.b:0 "Stona Donelo is elected."
 batvia.2.c:0 "Leon Vasto is elected."
 
 batvia.3.t:0 "Leon Vasto's Speech"
 batvia.3.d:0 "Delivering one of his well known tirades against the government, the leader of the Unione Nazionalista caused an uproar at his latest rally as he insisted that President Oxo has kowtowed to the socialists. The long winded speech drew much applause from the crowd. Nearing the end of his time at the podium, he asserted that the Unione Nazionalista was the country's last line of defense against socialism, vowing that, should he win the upcoming presidential election, he will fiercely crack down on the communists and syndicalists.\n\nAt a time where political radicalism is becoming normalized, it's slowly beginning to look like the election will come down to either Donelo or Vasto."
 batvia.3.a:0 "It seems Vasto has a way with words."
 
 batvia.4.t:0 "Donelo's Social Security Bill"
 batvia.4.d:0 "The communist congressman has announced his latest bill to congress, sponsored by his comrades in congress and even some liberal representatives, the bill would give economic aid to millions of Batvians struggling during the economic recession. Detractors of Donelo have cried foul, criticizing this move as a political stunt as the election draws nearer, and insisted this is far too costly and extreme to ever pass congress. President Oxo, on the other hand, has expressed some willingness to sign it into law, should it pass; interested in placating the growing socialist movement."
 batvia.4.a:0 "The Bill passes."
 batvia.4.b:0 "The Bill fails."
 
 batvia.5.t:0 "Vasto Protests"
 batvia.5.d:0 "The leader of the Unione Nazionalista has, during his weekly radio broadcast, launched into a long tirade, decrying our government and called the recent election rigged by the socialists. Though his fiery rhetoric remains, many suspect that his party is on its last legs, with a looming bankruptcy and a fear of government crackdown. Only time will tell if the Unione Nazionalista becomes a forgotten piece of Batvian history."
 batvia.5.a:0 "Who cares?"

 batvia.6.t:0 "More Radicals Announce Congressional Bids"
 batvia.6.d:0 "Lately, more and more communists and nationalists have announced serious congressional bids, transforming these movements into a larger force in Batvian political life.The 1936 election, seeing unprecedented amounts of newly registered voters pledging to support either the BCP or the Nationalist Union, have begun to worry the liberal and conservative political establishment."
 batvia.6.a:0 "Interesting."

 batvia.7.t:0 "A Formula for Stability"
 batvia.7.d:0 "The meeting between president Oxo and high ranking members of the Ufficio Generale di Sicurezza (UGS) happened behind closed doors, and was absent of even recorders to write down what was said inside. Arguments ensued inside the closed meeting, with each offering up their own solutions on how to deal with the extremist organizations that are cropping up everywhere in Batvian politics. Some suggested crackdowns of the socialists, arrests of more militant leaders on the premise of inciting violence, and - in hushed tones - proposals of assassinating the leaders of either the BCP and the Unione Nazionalista.\n\nOxo advised caution, fearing further backlash against the government. However, she does agree that something must be done - to save Batvian democracy."
 batvia.7.a:0 "Crackdown on the communists"
 batvia.7.b:0 "Crackdown on the nationalists"
 batvia.7.c:0 "Take out Stona Donelo"
 batvia.7.e:0 "Take out Leon Vasto"

 batvia.8.t:0 "The Last Legs of Batvian Liberalism"
 batvia.8.d:0 "In 1920, the Batvian stock market crashed, causing a storm of panic selling from investors. With the collapse of the syndicalist Organizzazione dei Lavoratori Liberi (OLL) in 1923, it was assumed that socialism - and to that extent, political radicalism - was defeated. Well, there was one turn of events the liberal government didn't count on with the fall of the syndicalist party - the rise of the communist party to take its place! In 1925, members of socialist organizations rallied behind a new vanguard of the revolution - the Partito Comunista Batviano. Their unlikely and charismatic leader, Stona Donelo, who grew up in a Vordok ghetto in Daverni, had begun the charge against racism and the failing capitalist system in Batvia.\n\nAt the other end of political radicalism, the Voulgerist (National Corporatist) Unione Nazionalista grew in reaction to the communists, determined to transform Batvia into a nationalist bulwark against their enemies. Syndicalism, communism, and even capitalism to name a few. Leon Vasto, heading the nationalists, had long decried the liberal government and the inaffective congress.\n\nWith radicalism on the rise and the stock market still in a sluggish recovery, street violence and mob justice have overtaken our cities. Despite the crisis, President Oxo remains stalwart in her belief in the democratic dream of Batvia."
 batvia.8.a:0 "When will these radicals give up?"

 batvia.9.t:0 "Leon Vasto Assassinated!"
 batvia.9.d:0 "The larger than life leader of the Unione Nazionalista, was outside the party headquarters when he was shot dead by an assailant, who was in turn shot dead by his bodyguard. While the killer's motives are ultimately unknown, the UN have blamed the BCP, which Stona Donelo has resolutely denied having any involvement in, passing the blame to the government.\n\nWith the death of Vasto, the inevitable decline of the Nazionalista has already begun. With the entire party built around his personality, the leadership has all but collapsed into a squabbling mess, with most former conservatives deserting the party."
 batvia.9.a:0 "Interesting."

 batvia.10.t:0 "Stona Donelo Assassinated!"
 batvia.10.d:0 "While returning from a meeting at the Daverni provincial legislator, Donelo was shot dead. There is currently a manhunt for the unknown assailant, but it's likely the shooter managed to escape into the shadows forever. Workers across the country mourn the loss of the communist leader, and a party election for a new leader is set to be underway - though it's unlikely they'll continue a run at the presidency."
 batvia.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 batvia.11.t:0 "Nationalist Organizations Banned"
 batvia.11.d:0 "Stona Donelo, in a fiery speech, declared the socialist reforms would have to wait just a little longer, as a much more pressing matter needed attention - the insidious influence the nationalists have over Batvia. In an effort to halt this rise of nationalism, strict guidelines have been placed on dissident organizations. Though mostly leaving socialist organizations untouched, most nationalist parties have been banned from congress - including the Unione Nazionalista.\n\nNo doubt, the enemies of socialism will protest these much needed measures."
 batvia.11.a:0 "It's for the good of Batvia!"

 batvia.12.t:0 "Riots of [GetMonth]"
 batvia.12.d:0 "After the recent banning of nationalist organizations, many former members of the Unione Nazionalista have taken to the streets in many of our cities. The largest gathering occuring in Adan. What started as a relatively peaceful protest soon turned violent as the police clashed with the mob. Things went from bad to worse, culminating in a bloody nationalist riot. Vordok-owned shops were attacked and burned in the chaos, and suspected communists were beaten to death in the streets.\n\nSome liberals in congress have asserted that the mob was had strong backing by the Kingdom of Oxumut, though these flimsy claims haven't been supported by hard evidence."
 batvia.12.a:0 "Arrest them all!"

 batvia.13.t:0 "Oxo Criticizes the President-Elect"
 batvia.13.d:0 "Limon Oxo has been vocal about her criticisms of the new president-elect, calling him "unfit to lead the country." She has also called on the moderates of congress to temper the radicalism of the president-elect."
 batvia.13.a:0 "Who cares?"

 batvia.14.t:0 "Oxo Criticizes the President-Elect"
 batvia.14.d:0 "Limon Oxo has been vocal about her criticisms of the new president-elect, calling the charismatic strongman "a danger to democracy." She has also called on the moderates of congress to temper the radicalism of the president-elect."
 batvia.14.a:0 "Who cares?"

 batvia.15.t:0 "The Fate of the SRC.GetNameDef"
 batvia.15.d:0 "The protection of the rump Synothesian Republic has long been criticized by many in congress. With the financial burden of the defense of SRC.GetNameDef from SYN.GetNameDef, the presidential elections have brought this argument further into the eyes of the public. With the radicals left and right of the political spectrum both arguing that the strain on our economy is not worth protecting our interests in the Synothesian peninsula.\n\nPresident Oxo, originally a proponent of safeguarding the republic, has also been left wondering if the cost was worth it in the wake of recent authoritarian upheaval in the small republic."
 batvia.15.a:0 "Withdraw our troops."
 batvia.15.b:0 "We can't just hand it over to the anarchists!"

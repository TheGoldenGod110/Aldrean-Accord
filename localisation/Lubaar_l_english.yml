 lubertatia.1.t:0 "The March West"
 lubertatia.1.d:0 "During the 2nd General Assembly of the Free Lubertatian Army, it was decisively decided that more open conflict with the Kingdom of James was all but impossible, and rather sought relocation of our territories. Our nascent rebellion, having survived this long, now has the means to march west into the Bordavan territory to our west and occupy new land. The locals of those territories, having long lived under a state of constant plunder and destruction from raiders, brigands and lawless disarray, will no doubt welcome our arrival.\n\nAny willing men, women, and children have been mobilized from our little sliver of land to migrate with our army. Perhaps one day, Free Lubertatia will cover the Bordavan lawless territories..."
 lubertatia.1.a:0 "Long live the free peoples of Lubertatia!"

 ###James Events###
 james.1.t:0 "The Coronation of William"
 james.1.d:0 "With the sudden death of David IV in late 1935, the kingdom was thrown into panic. The late king was the longest reigning sovereign in recent memory, with many having lived an entire lifetime under the same ruler. Expectedly, the national period of mourning brought forth an unearthly silence across the nation. Tens of thousands turned out to the streets of Cardinnia as the king's casket was carried to the royal funeral service.\n\nWilliam I, the former king's only son and heir apparent, subsequently ascended to the throne, later addressing the kingdom, stating a promise to continue his father's legacy. Today, as the youngest king in Lubaar's long history, William was coronated in the halls of the ancient vulguthist Temple of Cardinnia, where the bishop of Siram preformed the rites of the monarchy.\n\nLater, the king appeared on the balcony of Rihan Palace, greeted below by a throng of enthusiastic subjects. And some detractors..."
 james.1.a:0 "Long live the king!"

 james.2.t:0 "Standoff at Court"
 james.2.d:0 "William entered the room, only to find a madhouse. Duke Paulin II of Orboda and Marshal Dorsey were in the throws of a heated argument. "His majesty, King of Lubaar!" he was announced to the court. The room fell silent for a brief moment as the men stiffened their posture. As the king took a seat, the debate continued.\n\nThe two were arguing over matters of internal security and the army. Marshal Dorsey argued for widespread conscription, insisting that the local armies "quite simply can't defend the nation" in its current state. The Duke fired back, asserting that the kinghdom doesn't have the funds for expansion of the army. The circular argument continued for awhile.\n\n"The army serves the kingdom, not the other way around!" Cried the Duke, growing red in his face. The Marshall turned to William. "King, you must see reason - with the threats of popular uprising ever-present, the army needs the resources!" \n\nThe King knew he needed to restore civility in the courtroom quickly.\n\n"Enough!" William put his foot down. The Duke stood up. "Yes, indeed. Let's calm ourselves." The old Duke then took the king aside. "My king, I fear the Marshal thinks you naieve - and may try to take advantage."\n\nWilliam nodded, though quietly he felt a bit insulted by the Duke. As the council meeting officially began later, the two clashing on the topic, and he knew he would be forced to take the side of either the Duke or the Marshall, sooner or later."
 james.2.a:0 "Marshal Dorsey is right! We need more men!"
 james.2.b:0 "The Duke is right! We can't afford it!"

 james.3.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Attacks"
 james.3.d:0 "In the days after the celebration of the King's birthday, a slew of violent attacks was unleashed on government buildings; most notably that of the Interior Ministry headquarters, where three were killed by gunmen. Throughout the ordeal, only a handful of gunmen were able to be aprehended. Military Police took charge of the interrogations, later revealing a coordinated effort by underground anarchist terrorists to unleash an onslaught on the capitol. In the aftermath, a silence had fallen over the capital, with many fearing more violence. An emergency council was convened at the King's behest.\n\nThe Marshall had stormed into court as if charging into battle, and kneeled before the king.\n\n"My king. We must place the capitol under military law." Dorsey said.\n\nWilliam looked to the other members of the council, who gazed at Dorsey as if he were mad."Is that truely necessary, Marshal?"\n\nThe man rose to a stiffened posture."I'm afraid it is. My men have discovered a plot for further anarchist violence. We need to go door to door, and flush out the scum."\n\nThe king tapped his fingers on the table, thinking..."
 james.3.a:0 "Declare martial law!"
 james.3.b:0 "Surely that's not needed..."

 james.4.t:0 "The "Royal" Army"
 james.4.d:0 "In modern times, the royal army has become a growing concern among the governing nobility. Effectively running itself indepdently of the aging institutions, some consider it a rogue force, accountable to noone...But the king of course. That is, in theory at least. The kings of recent memory have seldom excercised power over the largely autonomous military. This has undoubtedly lead to arrogance among military leadership.\n\nGrowing anti-royal thought in the ranks and a protacted popular resistance have both been increasingly on the mind of the new king. And he was beginning to wonder if these problems had a common factor..."
 james.4.a:0 "Maybe one day the truth will be revealed."

 james.5.t:0 "Order Restored"
 james.5.d:0 "After many weeks of Loyalist riots and general civil unrest, the army has pushed the dissidents back into the shadows. The enemies of the new Lubaar have been either arrested or otherwise silenced. Finally, a new government can be formed from the ashes. Chosen by the military, of course."
 james.5.a:0 "Finally."

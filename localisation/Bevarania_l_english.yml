 ###Assassination Events
 
 bevarania.1.t:0 "The Assassination of Louis"
 bevarania.1.d:0 "Today, the Emperor was shot dead on the steps of parliament by multiple gunmen. After the ensuing firefight between police and the attackers, the assailants were left dead, their motives forever unknown."
 bevarania.1.a:0 "The world's fate has no doubt changed."
 
 bevarania.2.t:0 "Aftermath of the Assassination"
 bevarania.2.d:0 "In the days following the death of Louis II, chaos has erupted all across the country. Political violence and protests, some them supporting the monarchy and others decrying it, has shaken our capital of Vellois.\n\nThis is the day that the enemies of the crown have been waiting for. Martin Sortel and the Parti National Voulgeriste (PNV) intend to capitalize on the crisis, and are expected to make bold moves to seize power.\n\nThe Fédération Holmariste (FH) has made their own moves as well, pleading to the Worker's International for their support, hoping to stop the - present or future - government from outlawing their organisation.\n\nEmperor Robert has yet to speak publicly, sparking concern over the new emperor's ability to lead the country."
 bevarania.2.a:0 "Sortel demands Robert's abdication!"
 bevarania.2.b:0 "Robert makes a speech."
 
 bevarania.3.t:0 "Voulgerists March on Vellois"
 bevarania.3.d:0 "Just a few days ago, Robert IV chose to sign a short letter announcing his abdication. The letter, making little to no assurements to the nobles that they would retain any of their power and leaving no successor government, caused the country to enter a state of panic. The imperial council called elections for the first time the following day.\n\nHowever, Martin Sortel had other plans. Organizing many of his supporters, and seizing the opportunity of a largely vacant government, Sortel marched on the capital of Vellois, demanding the surrender of the rump government.\n\nThe Imperial council was quickly dissolved, with the old Bevaranian order toppled without violence. Martin Sortel then assumed the role of president of the new voulgerist republic.\n\nSome greeted his ascension to power with applause and demonstrations in support of the new regime. Although, across the country, almost as many bitterly maligned the new republic, either wishing to return to the monarchy or fearing for the future of individual liberties."
 bevarania.3.a:0 "The end of an era."
 
 bevarania.4.t:0 "The Bevaranian Royal Family"
 bevarania.4.d:0 "Fleeing the voulgerist takeover in the former Bevaranian Empire, Robert IV and his family have arrived in Treia by train, exiled and seeking asylum within our borders. Should we give them refuge?"
 bevarania.4.a:0 "Absolutely!"
 bevarania.4.b:0 "They are useless to us."
 
 ###Voulgerist Events###
 
 bevarania.5.t:0 "The End of the Aldrean Accord"
 bevarania.5.d:0 "With the end of the Bevaranian monarchy, the other member states of the Aldrean Accord have rejected our republic as the legitimate government in Bevarania. President Sortel has responded by stationing troops along the border of the Velugia and Avelly. Though no official statements have taken place, it is safe to say the alliance is over."
 bevarania.5.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 
 ###Constitution Events###
 
 bevarania.6.t:0 "The New Bevarania"
 bevarania.6.d:0 ""
 
 bevarania.7.t:0 "The Comité de Constitution Voulgeriste Begins"
 bevarania.7.d:0 "With a government elected, the Comité de Constitution Voulgeriste (CCV) has been formed and has begun drafting a new constitution for our fledgling republic, with the newly elected PNV representatives of the Parlement now debating what goes into the document.\n\nThe nationalist wing of the Fédération Holmariste, which was initially accepted into the Parlement and CCV, was ejected from both after proposing to the Parlament that the country join the Worker's International.\n\nAt the end of the first day of the Comité de Constitution Voulgeriste, President Sortel was asked to appoint either a head of the Parlament, or, merge the post with the presidency - which is something that may cause controversy."
 bevarania.7.a:0 "Merge the posts of chancellor and president."
 bevarania.7.b:0 "Appoint Nathan Brasseur - The Propagandist"
 bevarania.7.c:0 "Appoint Remily Maxian - The Grand Protector"
 
 bevarania.8.t:0 "CCV Day 2: the Government in Theory"
 bevarania.8.d:0 "There is no doubt among the people that the green flag flies over the country, but some have begun to wonder what that means for them.\n\nThe Comité has met for it's second day, this time with the objective of enshrining party agenda into the constitution itself. The President has weighed in heavily here, ensuring that these additions have the nation's best interest at heart. Thus, a broad focus on nationalism and radical futurism is all but ensured, but there are more hotly debated topics among the Comité, such as the class character of the party itself. Since the early days of the Voulgerist movement, this has historically been a point of contention and has caused many major divides. The hardline Vasseurists in our party strictly advocate for class collaboration 'for the good of the nation, at any cost', while the National Labourists want a working-class focused agenda. These two factions had put aside their differences to overthrow the monarchy, but it seems that no matter of the outcome of today, some party division will likely be sowed."
 bevarania.8.a:0 "National Labourists: Worker-focused agenda"
 bevarania.8.b:0 "Vasseurists: Class collaboration agenda."

 ###Leader Descriptions###
 VEL_HoG_leah_foster_desc:0 "Leah Foster was born in Otsoby, near Horjby, to a family of steelworkers and oilworkers, as the youngest of three. Very much a working-class girl, she worked her first job at a grocery at the age of 15 to make ends meet. At the beginning of the Hadernish revolution, she was drawn to the political radicalism of the trade unions, participating in her first strike at the age of 17.\n\nFoster had no formal political allegiances before her time studying at the university of Horjby, where she met and became the protégé of the libertarian-syndicalist professor Johan Horner. In the years ahead of her studies, she became a journalist for the syndicalist paper, 'De Verkat.' There, she quickly rose to become perhaps its most prominent writer, often writing on the subject of gender equality.\n\nIn 1934, Foster ran for Federal Congress at the behest of General Secretary Bergen, later finding herself at the center of a political rivalry between her old professor, Johan Horner, and Bergen, his political adversary. Though initially impressed by Bergen, Leah quickly became disillusioned by the political establishment and horrified by the General Secretary's authoritarian outlook, and quickly came out in support of Horner's cause.\n\nFoster's meteoric rise in the Federal Congress had only begun. In the following months, she earned a controversial reputation for passionately fighting against the powers that be.\n\nWhile the young women's status becomes more widely known, it will only become harder to keep her many secrets from the public."

 ###Intro Events###

 hadernland.1.t:0 "The Union of Hadernland"
 hadernland.1.d:0 "In 1921, the Verdenskrig, which had seen the most devestating loss of life the continent had ever known, ended inconclusively. Enraged by parliament's inability to repeal the wartime rationing act, the people took to the streets. After weeks of rioting, the country's largest confederation of syndicalist trade unions, the Hadernsk Arbejdskonfederation (HAK), declared a nationwide general strike across the Kingdom of Hadernland. Soon after, the various socialist parties threw their weight behind the striking syndicalists.\n\nOriginally only demanding the repeal of the rationing act on the strained people, their demands changed in February of 1922 when an outbreak of army mutinies supported the syndicalist cause. With greatly increased bargaining power, the Arbejdskonfederation sent new demands: the resignation of parliament and the abdication of the kesjer. Narrowly avoiding civil war, the kesjer accepted the terms later that month, adbicating the throne and exiling himself after delivering a letter to parliament, asking for their resignation.\n\nA short lived provisional government formed by liberals and social democrats was declared after the collapse of the kingdom, but was quickly overturned by the Arbejdskonfederation that controlled the north, which later declared a unified syndicalist republic. As a compromise between the HAK and the largest socialist parties, the Federal Congress - the new republic's multi-party syndicalist legislature - was born. The Federal Congress's first act was to repeal the rationing laws. A largely symbolic act that successfully gained the trust of the people.\n\nWith the revolution successful and the corrupt kleptocrats driven out, the new, syndicalist Hadernland could prosper."
 hadernland.1.a:0 "Raise the ruby banner!"

 hadernland.40.t:0 "Trouble in the New Hadernland"
 hadernland.40.d:0 "In the years after the revolution, socialist party and syndicalist organization membership skyrocketed. The HAK and FVP, under the Labour coalition, managed to keep a firm grasp on the congress in the government's early years with minimal opposition. It even became an established tradition for Chairman Karlan - the leader of the HAK - to appoint a member of the allied FVP to the post of General Secretary, symbolizing the unity of Labour.\n\nChange came swiftly when, in 1933, an election upset in the congress briefly placed the FVP at the head of the coalition - allowing for far-reaching centralist legislation to slip by. The most infamous of which was the 'Centralised Government Act,' which relegated the provincial legislatures to that of an advisory role with little real powers.\n\nMany in the HAK saw this as a betrayal of their alliance and syndicalism as a whole. When the chair was back in the hands of the HAK the following year, representatives called on Chairman Karlan to reverse the 'ill-advised' centralising acts, which ultimately fell on deaf ears.\n\nWith the forming of the left-opposition Socialdemokratisk Venstrepartiet (SDV) and the HAK now divided between the establishment Unionists and the growing libertarian-syndicalist Federationists, fractures began to form in government as the congress slowed to a halt.\n\nAs the crisis in governmant continued into 1936, it fueled the meteoric rise of the radical reactionary Nasjonalt Republikanske Partiet, which soon became the largest political organization outside of the Federal Congress. Now, as the congressional elections draw nearer, many around the country hold their breath, fearing some form of political upheaval in the near future."
 hadernland.40.a:0 "This isn't good."

 hadernland.52.t:0 "Another Day in the Congress"
 hadernland.52.d:0 "A bill had been brought to the floor of the congress - what must have been the tenth of its kind - to take action against reactionary groups. Namely, the NRP. This is what Leah Foster had been writing down in her journal. On the floor of Hadernish Congress, Leah would often sit silently, listening to the other member's arguments, writing their words and positions, and taking notes. It was always her hope that - when it came time for her to say her piece, she would have her thoughts and arguments in order, and she plainly knew who her enemies were.\n\nThe bill had once again failed after a short vote. Leah wrote which way the other representatives had voted, and which groups opposed and supported it. The FVP member who had proposed it this time had the support of the Alma Bergen and the other vanguardists. Most others - Leah included, had voted no this time, mostly citing its overt authoritarianism.\n\nWhen an HAK member inevitably brings a more moderate bill to the floor to combat the NRP, the FVP will no doubt strike it down as well, saying that it doesn't go far enough. Simply put, nothing important was ever getting done.\n\nBy the time the congress had adjourned for the day, many words had been said, many arguments had ensued, Leah had written another few pages, but not much had changed."
 hadernland.52.a:0 "Another day adjourned."

 hadernland.53.t:0 "A Northern Accent" ###TODO: Not done yet
 hadernland.53.d:0 "It wasn't uncommon for other representatives to ask Leah Foster to repeat herself. No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't shake her particularly northern accent in a government largely dominated by southerners. Sometimes, she'd even catch some snickering, sneering comments behind her back.\n\n "

 hadernland.54.t:0 "Kept Hidden"
 hadernland.54.d:0 "Many would think Leah was living immorally if they knew her secret. And part of her knew it was wrong, too. Other representatives - typically FVP ones - were constantly ranting against homosexuals. It wasn't against the law, but it was clear that some thought that it should be.\n\nIt had been a couple months since she and Katja began seeing eachother. It started innocent enough at first - meeting in the committee for gender equality, Katja had seemed so lonely. They had quickly become friends outside of congress. Talking turned into flirting, and soon enough, they were in love.\n\nCongress adjourned for the day, with the rest of the representatives clearing off. Leah waited in her office for the dawdlers to leave, and snuck around to one of their many secret meeting spots in a secluded area of the courtyard. There she was, standing in the corner, twirling her ginger hair. An ear-to-ear smile formed on her dimpled face as she saw Leah.\n\nThe two held eachother close in an affectionate hug.\n\n"Where were you? I've been waiting nearly a half-hour," Katja said, releasing her grasp.\n\n"I had to make sure it was safe."\n\nKatja laughed a tad, "You're always too careful, darling."\n\nLeah was tempted to voice her worries, but instead kissed her; though softly at first, as Katja's lips clinged to her, it soon became the only solid thing in a dizzying world."
 hadernland.54.a:0 "I love you."

 hadernland.56.t:0 "Cruel Rumors"
 hadernland.56.d:0 "The bike sheds behind the corner store was the safest place to meet. Leah knew the shopkeeps well, and trusted they wouldn't speak a word if they saw anything. She crossed the street, frequently glacing over her shoulder to check that she wasn't being followed. As she snuck around the shop and turned the corner into bike sheds, she made out a subtle sobbing. It was Katja, sitting against the wall with her head burrowed in her legs.\n\n"Katja? What's wrong, dear?" Leah said softly. Katja pulled her head up and gazed at Leah with puffy, red eyes; looking terribly exhausted.\n\n"I'm sorry. They..." She sniffled and wiped her nose. "I had no choice."\n\nLeah's heart sank to the pit of her stomach. She sat down beside Katja, placing a hand over her shoulder. "What happened?"\n\n"Some FVP troublmakers came to my office today... Said they had dirt on me. They know about us, Leah." Katja caught her breath. "They forced me to write a confession, threatening to have me arrested as a reactionary."\n\nLeah was furious. Not at her, of course. Trying not to contort her face into a mess, she pulled Katja in close. "Who were they?"\n\nKatja pulled back, and suddenly became stiff. "I can't tell you... They might hurt you.""
 hadernland.56.a:0 "They'll pay for this."

 hadernland.55.t:0 "The Assassination of Henry Witting"
 hadernland.55.d:0 "At 12:30PM yesterday, Henry Witting, one of the major representatives within the Federationist wing of the HAK, was shot in broad daylight while returning to his home in Kalvar. The perpetrator of the attack quickly fled, scurrying back into the shadows before the police arrvied at the scene.\n\nWith the sudden death, the Federal Congress has entered a state of chaos. Witting, supposedly suspected of being a target in the past, had been assured by the Federal Security Committee that were was no such threat. Now, some in congress - such as HAK representative Horner - have already made public statements, placing varying degrees of blame on the security committee and its head, Alma Bergen, for their inaction.\n\nIn the aftermath of the death, many have been left speculating on the motives of the killer - with some already accusing the NRP of being behind the killing."

 hadernland.2.t:0 "The 1936 Federal Congress begins"
 hadernland.2.d:0 "The silence of the Federal Congress Building, accompanied by the echoing voice of the chairman and muffled whispers from representatives, signalled the beginning of the 1936 congress.\n\n 'As the revolution endures another year, we see the integrity and humanity of socialism in affect across our nation. And these halls, where the people are represented, we have to thank for that.' As Chairman Karlan finished his opening address, the room was filled with uneasy applause. The formality lacked the usual enthusiasm, and was clearly tainted by a faltering confidence in government.\n\nMany suspect that this year's congress would be an extraordinary one, and would determine the direction of the country for the foreseeable future. As the once entrenched political establishment crumbles, rumours swirl of the Chairman's future resignation. We shall see what happens when the dust settles."
 hadernland.2.a:0 "Let it begin."
 
 hadernland.3.t:0 "Economy Vote"
 hadernland.3.d:0 "The question of the economy has always been a contentious one in the nascent Federal Congress. Since the inaugural congress was held in late 1922, most mines, utilities, roads, railways and other industries had been nationalized and handed over to independent trade unions who are represented by members of members of the Arbejdsverkat. Members of the FVP would rather the trade unions be brought under the control of federal government directly, possibly under a single, big union. There is a notable divide between HAK Unionists who wish to keep the economy running smoothly under the status quo, and HAK Føderationists, who want to fully realize syndicalist industrial democracy. The SDV represents moderate socialist economics, supporting market socialism."
 hadernland.3.a:0 "HAK Unionists: The economy is already working!"
 hadernland.3.b:0 "SDV: Market socialism!"
 hadernland.3.c:0 "FVP: Large-scale centralisation."
 hadernland.3.e:0 "HAK Føderationists: Worker self-determination!"
 
 hadernland.4.t:0 "Internal Politics Debate"
 hadernland.4.d:0 "The Union of Hadernland is a nation with a syndicalist economy, though its legislature is hardly syndicalist - depending on who you ask. Hadernish Federal Congress was formed in a compromise by socialist parties and syndicalist federations in 1922. This unicameral legislature is officially considered a multi-party one, yet all major organizations represented in the congress support some form of socialism. All representatives are elected by municipality and, in some cases such as the HAK, trade union elections; and the Chairman is elected by Congressional majority, who then appoints the executive branch.\n\nThe Hadernsk Arbejdskonfederation (HAK) is the largest syndicalist federation in the congress, representing the vast majority of all trade unions in the country. The HAK makes up a sort of informal lower chamber within the congress. The FVP have always seen this political reality as a major obstacle for the socialist state, and would rather a single vanguard lead the revolution.\n\nMany in the HAK are in stark disagreement with the FVP, arguing that the "qualified unicameralism" in congress should end be replace by a full, bicameral legislature. The coalition of between the FVP and HAK seems to be breaking down further, as this issue lays bear their striking disagreements.\n\nThe SDV opposition has again broken from the rest of the congress, making the argument for a return to parliamentarianism."
 hadernland.4.a:0 "HAK: Argue for a bicameral legislature."
 hadernland.4.b:0 "SDV: Argue for parliamentarianism."
 hadernland.4.c:0 "FVP: Argue for a Syndicalist vanguard."
 
 hadernland.5.t:0 "Military Policy"
 hadernland.5.d:0 "As tensions in Aldrea slowly begin to rise, the topic of defending our nation has become more and more important to the Federal Congress, though it has also laid bare the deep rift within the congress. Currently, our military is split between the Arbejdermilits, our locally organised militia forces, and the Rød Hær, our standing army.\n\nLately, the militias have become deeply unpopular among FVP delegates of the congress, who see them as an undisciplined force that cannot properly protect the nation. They insist that the local militias need to be disbanded or absorbed into our standing army. The HAK Federationists and the SDV and have made a sort of informal alliance in opposition to that idea, favouring militia reform, so it is unlikely that the FVP will win the debate."
 hadernland.5.a:0 "HAK: The Army is fine!"
 hadernland.5.b:0 "HAK Feds & SDV: Reform the militias!"
 hadernland.5.c:0 "FVP: Centralize the army." 
 
 hadernland.6.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 hadernland.6.d:0 "As the leading member of the Workers' International, we must make our positions and aims clear. While all delegates of the Arbeidsforbund agree that we should build socialism, there is yet another bitter divide on how to, or even if we should, attempt to spread it. The FVP have been criticized and called 'bloodthirsty' by their opponents in federal congress for their aggressive, jingoistic opinions towards Bevarania, while virtually all HAK representatives only desire to warn the Bevaranian government not to provoke the Workers' International. Orlan Stenling and the SDV, ardently anti-war, seek to ignore outside foes altogether."
 hadernland.6.a:0 "HAK: We must remain vigilant."
 hadernland.6.b:0 "SDV: We must do all we can to safeguard peace."
 hadernland.6.c:0 "FVP: We must fight the reactionaries, wherever they may be!"
 
 hadernland.7.t:0 "Henrik Karlan Resigns"
 hadernland.7.d:0 "'Perhaps the chairman would prefer to do nothing and watch our country crumble!' Was the sharp cry of representative Foster in the congress last week in response to Henry Witting's death. Many others spoke similiar words in the following days. And as the chairman's wavering support collapsed, nearly all representatives in the congress - barring the ever shrinking old-guard of the HAK - began calling for the his resignation. Staring down the barrel of the preverbial gun and facing a looming vote of no confidence from Johan Horner, Karlan had little choice but to take the speakers podium today, announcing his resignation.\n\n 'To have served in office this long, it has truly been an honour. In leaving it, I part with these words: May the country press on, and may the people continue to prosper under syndicalism.' The final words of the chairman left the federal congress shocked - if not a little relieved.\n\n For the second time in the history of the nascent republic, the coming election was unclear. General Secretary Bergen has made brief statements in the aftermath of the resignation, stating a clear intention to win the upcoming election and 'do whatever it takes to preserve syndicalism' against the reactionaries.\n\nJohan Horner and his federationist supporters, primarily made up of newer HAK representatives and formerly independent trade-unionists, have their begun their own push in the aftermath of the resignation. Planning to overturn the political establishment that is becoming less and less popular, they are working tirelessly to elect Horner as the HAK candidate for his libertarian syndicalist and reformist ideals.\n\nThe coming election could easily shape up to a race between bitter rivals Bergen and Horner."
 hadernland.7.a:0 "A sad day for the congress."
 hadernland.7.b:0 "Horner takes the speaker's podium..."
 
 hadernland.8.t:0 "The Forsamlinghal Rally" ###TODO add in the fact that the movement was birthed out of the decay of democracy in hadernland
 hadernland.8.d:0 "As Federal Congress continued their standstill, Halvard Bowker, leader of the revolutionary Nasjonalt Republikanske Partiet, held a massive party congress at the Forsamlinghal in Ressen. Some 14 thousand attended the event. His speech, which was broadcast on the radio, reached many of those dissatisfied with the syndicalist government. At the end of his speech, Bowker concluded with a straight-forward call to action: 'It's either future or ruin for our country.'\n\nThe aftermath of this rally has been nothing less than a political earthquake. The NRP, only a fringe party a year ago, has now risen to be the largest political organization in the country outside of the Federal Congress. Though syndicalism, especially Horner's brand of syndicalism, remains resolutely popular with the working class in places such as Haelland, dissenting citizens are flocking to the NRP in southern provinces.\n\nWhile Bowker himself hasn't yet outwardly preached violent action against the government, members of the NRP have already attempted - and succeeded - in plotting acts of political violence in the past. Whether Bowker had any part in those acts remains a secret. And now, no doubt exacerbated by Bowker's 'future or ruin' speech, political violence has seen a marked increase in the last few weeks.\n\nWhile the congress is locked in arguments, the reactionary movement shows no signs of slowing."
 hadernland.8.a:0 "Won't someone do something!?"
 
 hadernland.9.t:0 "Internal Security"
 hadernland.9.d:0 "There has never been a time in the Federal Congress' history where internal security has been more paramount, with mounting fears of political assassinations and reactionary uprisings coming to a boiling point. Now, under the current political establishment, it is unlikely that any real legislation against dissenters will come to pass, however, whichever faction manages to sway enough delegates in the debate may increase their support for future administrations."
 hadernland.9.a:0 "HAK Federationists: We need to suppress active threats to the people."
 hadernland.9.b:0 "SDV: We can't become tyrants in the quest for security!"
 hadernland.9.c:0 "FVP: The reactionaries should fear us."
 
 hadernland.201.t:0 "Auden Haestad Becomes the HAK Candidate"
 hadernland.201.d:0 "A calm voice of reason in the Federal Congress, Auden Haestad gave a rather persuasive speech to the congress in the hopes of easing the factionalism. He went on to promise concessions to each of the factions, should he win the coming election, and continue to hold the Federal Congress together through compromise.\n\nHorner, dismayed at Haestad's candidacy, has vowed to keep pushing his version of syndicalism, despite the 'utter lunacy of congress,' as he put it."
 hadernland.201.a:0 "Haestad does it!"

 hadernland.10.t:0 "Johan Horner Becomes the HAK Candidate" ###TODO: possibly take a second look at this
 hadernland.10.d:0 "Echoing a call for change in the congress, the Hadernsk AK held a vote to confirm Johan Horner's candidacy in the upcoming election. Horner, a well known critic of the political establishment and authoritarianism espoused by some federal representatives, has eagerly accepted the position and promised a platform of radical reform.\n\nHorner, coming from a background in education at the University of Oslen, has also chosen Leah Foster, a former Protégé turned political activist in the congress, as his running mate for the post of General Secretary, should the HAK keep hold of their majority in the upcoming election. Critics, like his longtime rival Alma Bergen, have labeled Horner an unkempt anarchist undeserving of political office, and have called Foster, a new representative 25 years of age, far too young for such a responsibility.\n\nDespite the sneers of some, the HAK have bet all they have on Horner and Foster, for any hope of positive change, or at least in hopes of keeping the HAK in charge of government."
 hadernland.10.a:0 "Horner does it!"
 
 hadernland.11.t:0 "Hadernsk AK Secure a Majority"
 hadernland.11.d:0 "Johan Horner and his running mate Leah Foster have won the election in a landslide victory! Johan Horner will now become the next chairman of the Federal Congress, with his running mate Leah Foster becoming General Secretary and taking charge of the Federal Security Committee (FSK)."
 hadernland.11.a:0 "Congratulations, comrade Horner."

 hadernland.200.t:0 "Hadernsk AK Secure a Majority"
 hadernland.200.d:0 "Auden Haestad, an establishment politician, has won a narrow victory in the election. He will now become the next chairman of the Federal Congress."
 hadernland.200.a:0 "Congratulations, comrade Haestad."
 
 hadernland.12.t:0 "SDV Secure a Majority"
 hadernland.12.d:0 "Orlan Stenling won a stunning upset in the election! He will now become the next chairman of the Federal Congress. This marks the first time in the history of the syndicalist republic of an official opposition victory."
 hadernland.12.a:0 "Congratulations, comrade Stenling."
 
 hadernland.13.t:0 "FVP Secure a Majority"
 hadernland.13.d:0 "Alma Bergen has won a stunning victory in the election! She will now become the next chairwoman of the Federal Congress."
 hadernland.13.a:0 "Congratulations, comrade Bergen"
 
 hadernland.14.t:0 "No Majority Achieved"
 hadernland.14.d:0 "The ballots have been counted and no clear majority has been achieved. What should we do?"
 hadernland.14.a:0 "Compromise with the SDV."
 hadernland.14.b:0 "Compromise with the FVP."
 
 hadernland.20.t:0 "Mending the Rifts"
 hadernland.20.d:0 "Horner, upon assuming the position of chairman, was soon faced with a frustrating reality in the congress. Despite his victory in the election, the congress is still as divided as ever. With the collapse of the HAK-FVP Labour coalition, a new political reality of distrust is dawning. Even the old-guard of the HAK, while outwardly supporting the new chairman, only give backhanded tacit approval at the very best, and actively plot to obstruct the new administration at worst.\n\nHoping to vanquish any future threats to his reforms and repair a deeply entrenched divide in government, Horner sought to court more allies. So, albeit reluctantly, he met with the heads of the other parties. Ultimately, to the chairman's dismay, during the eventful meeting, none of the larger factions seemed to be interested in reconciling with one another. To make matters worse, Alma Bergen has refused to meet, openly denouncing Horner, and has vowed to defeat any bills he puts up.\n\nHorner now faces two choices, either spend the effort to convince the old guard of the HAK, or seek allies within the SDV."
 hadernland.20.a:0 "Ally with the SDV!"
 hadernland.20.c:0 "Persuade the old guard of the HAK."
 
 hadernland.42.t:0 "Bergen Protests the Hadernsk AK" ###TODO: Turn this event into something else
 hadernland.42.d:0 "Change this"
 hadernland.42.a:0 "Let them whine all they want."
 
 hadernland.43.t:0 "Foster Accuses Bergen"
 hadernland.43.d:0 "Leah Foster, who has gone to the Attorney General with some damning information, has now asked the courts to submit a criminal case against Alma Bergen, alleging blackmail, forgery, conspiracy, and most shocking of all, having a hand in the planning of the bombing attack in Oslen that supposedly targeted her.\n\nSome of the evidence includes Bergen's letters of correspondence with members of the Voulgerist Hadernsk Rige during the civil war, including a particularly damning one to Halvard Bowker before his overthrow of the south. Foster also submitted letters between herself and Bergen's close assosciates, with attempted blackmailing, and believed with reasonable amounts of evidence that Bergen was behind the blackmailing of Katja Birk, who was ceorced into revealing her personal relationship with the General Secretary in an attempt to slander them both.\n\nLeah Foster, as head of the KSF, has ordered the arrest of Bergen on these charges, and is now being held in custody. Though, the choice of whether to persue the case is up to the Attorney General of the People's Supreme Court. This will likely ruffle some feathers of - and possibly enrage - some members of the Federal Congress."
 hadernland.43.a:0 "Another traitor!"
 
 hadernland.44.t:0 "Attempted Red Guard Coup"
 hadernland.44.d:0 "Yesterday, the FVP Red Guards, a group of vanguardist radicals loyal solely to Alma Bergen and the FVP, swarmed the capitol. Gathering outside the Federal Congress chamber and shouting at local police and militia forces protecting the representatives inside. Determined to continue their work, Federal Congress did not call a recess during the demonstration.\n\nThe FVP representatives, believing that the arrest of their former head was politically motivated, were supportive of the Red Guards. However, it wasn't long before the Red Guards began to clash with police, overrunning them and forcing entry in the Congress. Armed and refusing to leave, they demanded that not only Bergen be released, but that Horner resign as well. Some FVP members of congress gave short speeches in support of the demands, and even joined in on the calls to give in to their demands.\n\nThis didn't last for long, as the army and police arrived to clear the building of the rioters. This resulted in the fatal shooting of one of the Red Guards.\n\nIn the aftermath, Horner approached the speaker's podium, calling for all FVP supporters of the attempted coup to be expelled from the Federal Congress. An emergency vote was held that night, passing easily, expelling 11 member from congress. General Secretary Foster, the next day, announced the arrests of several prominent Red Guard leaders implicated in the attack."
 hadernland.44.a:0 "Even more traitors!"

 hadernland.47.t:0 "The Plot of [GetMonth]"
 hadernland.47.d:0 "No one was allowed inside the closed door meeting between General Secretary Alma Bergen and the security committee, and no one recorded what was said inside. The latest meeting was part of a string of meetings focused on the federal congress representative Johan Horner, who the General Secretary has long perceived as a danger to the congress and to syndicalism. The committee, having failed to recruit Leah Foster, Horner's closest associate, to their cause, had to then discuss alternate ways of keeping Horner in check.\n\nWith the forthcoming elections, and the possibility of Horner's victory, Bergen has asked for more immediate solutions. Some members of the committe have suggested accusing the congressman of political crimes and placing him under arrest; though others have advised more cautious approaches. However, bold actions may be needed to stop Horner in his tracks."
 hadernland.47.a:0 "Horner is clearly a reactionary! Remove him from congress!"
 hadernland.47.b:0 "Horner is part of a criminal conspiracy to overthrow syndicalism! Arrest him!"
 hadernland.47.c:0 "Continue to carefully watch Horner and Foster."

 hadernland.48.t:0 "Bergen's Victory"
 hadernland.48.d:0 "Shocking congress, the expected winner of the upcoming election, Johan Horner, has been arrested on conspiracy charges. Some members of the Federal Congress have suspicions that these charges are a sham by the General Secretary, who allege that she colluded with the security committee to fabricate the evidence which led to his arrest. She has fervently denied these allegations. Nevertheless, the arrest of Horner has swung the election in acting chairwoman Bergen's favor, who will now officially assume the role of chairwoman. Though this comes as a shock to many, the shrinking political establishment breathes a sigh of relief, if only temporarily..."
 hadernland.48.a:0 "Congratulations, comrade Bergen...?"

 hadernland.49.t:0 "Horner Expelled from Congress" ###TODO: Need an Event for a 'great purge' of sorts
 hadernland.49.d:0 "Shocking the nation, the expected winner of the upcoming election, Johan Horner, was forcibly expelled from the Federal Congress by acting chairwoman on suspicions of reactionary sympathies. Fear and anger from other members of congress and voters has ensued, who now largely consider the elections a sham. Representative Foster delivered an enraged speech to the Federal Congress in the days after, accusing the new chairwoman of tyranny and perverting the revolution. She was later forcibly removed from congress as well.\n\nThe few reporters who were brave enough to speak out against the supposed 'coup', equating Bergen to a dictator, did not speak for very long."

 hadernland.36.t:0 "Trial of the Traitors"
 hadernland.36.d:0 "With Bowker and his inner circle in our custody, the court of the Union of Hadernland have begun their trial. The trial took place in Kalvar. Many members of congress, including Leah Foster and Johan Horner, viewed the proceedings, with Horner meeting Bowker face to face for the first time in a tense moment before the trial began.\n\nThe charges Bowker was on trial for included treason against the Union of Hadernland, sedition, war crimes including massacres of civilians, unlawful detention of civilians including forced labour, and widespread rape committed under him by the green army. Fred Nielsen, the lawer arguing for the defense, claimed that the misdeeds done against civilians by the Green Army did not go entirely unpunished, and even claimed that the syndicalist forces had committed the worse crimes. Additionally, Nielson stated that Bowker took great measures to end the mob violence in urban centers that struck the country before the civil war. Barely any jury members were swayed by the patchy defense.\n\nIn the end, Bowker and the other defendants plead guilty to orchestrating a widespread force labour system, and, in their closing arguments, attempted to justify its existence to the jury, citing food shortages during the war. The outcome of the trial was expected, with all of the defendants eventually found guilty, awaiting sentencing..."

Following the restoration of syndicalist governance in the south, the FVP have argued that former voulgerist industry be nationalized and managed by federal government for the forseeable future. HAK and SDV representatives however, have called for the return of trade union ownership of their respective industries, with some saying the FVP proposal was "anti-syndicalist."\n\nShould the FVP proposal pass, it would undoubtedly significantly weaken the HAK affiliated Trade Unions further in the south."

 hadernland.58.d:0 "The conference in Oslen was open to the public, with representatives and the people alike being able to directly vote on amendments to the new and better syndicalist constitution. Unsurprisingly, the Arbejdskonfederation and SDV made up the majority of attending delegates and voters, with meager turnout for the near-defunct FVP and other interest groups. Though, with many disagreements in the HAK, there will still be much room for debate.\n\nOn the first day of the conference, controversy erupted as many delegates voted to prohibit communist party representatives from entering the discussion. Later that day, Horner spoke on the subject, stating that "This conference is primarily a syndicalist and trade union one.""

Opposing the syndicalist order entirely, questions have been raised if the party should be allowed into Federal Congress. Still, small numbers of communist representatives have already found their way into congress, in both the upper and lower house. Many in the HAK fear that authoritarian nature of the small but growing communist movement will bring more bitter opposition to our libertarian-socialist government. Ultimately, many within the new political establishment will have to remain alert."

Foster's proposal for all legislative power to be vested in trade union councils, with representatives elected by wall-to-wall union elections, was supported by Chairman Horner. He then went on to rebuke the 1922 legislative compromise, decrying the failure and authoritarianism of the past federal government.\n\nFrank Hjort, HAK representative an current Foreign Affairs Deputy, opposing the idea, has positioned himself as a man of compromise. Echoing the words of the opposition, he claimed that subordination to the trade unions and the HAK is no different than a single party state. Foster rose to strongly object, saying that council based democracy will prevent tyranny of a central government, not promote it."

 ###Hadernish Civil War: Chairman Horner###
 
 hadernland.15.t:0 "Horner the Tyrant!"
 hadernland.15.d:0 "In response to the election of Chairman Horner in the Federal Congress, the NRP has started a propaganda war against him and his administration. Openly targeting members of the conservative HKP and the liberal LDP, they claim Horner will subvert their civil liberties in his measures against non-syndicalist organisations. While this has been strongly rebuked by Horner himself, this has certainly seemed to have played well on the fears of liberals and conservatives, with some opting to join the NRP.\n\nAfter this recent surge in popularity, Bowker spoke publically once again, encouraging members of the NRP to join the Gronvagt, the paramilitary arm of the organisation which has until now been organised mostly in secret. While technically a banned organisation, corrupt police with far-right sympathies, which has been an increasingly worrying development in recent years, have largely looked the other way towards them as the previous administration dragged their feet on the issue. Bowker's recent brazenness has greatly alarmed many members of the Federal Congress, causing Horner to call an emergency session with the intent to take action against the NRP."

 hadernland.16.t:0 "[GetMonth] Riots"
 hadernland.16.d:0 "Violence has overtaken the streets of many of our sourthern cities in the last few days as our country descends into chaos. Voulgerist rioters and syndicalist counter-protesters are engaging in violent altercations at many of these riots. The NRP, claiming that they have proof of syndicalists 'attacking un-unionized workers' and brandishing weapons at these events, have further fueled the unrest.\n\nBowker, all but calling for armed resistance now, has had his radio permit revoked, but the damage has already been done. With local governments in the south outright refusing to investigate rioters - whether in protest of federal government or out of fear of riprisal - many fear the worst is ahead. A few towns have even become occupied by reactionary groups, who have declared them 'provisional republics.' Bowker, using the confusion and atmosphere of terror to his advantage, has called on the people to 'save the country from syndicalist violence.'\n\nYesterday, Horner stood before the congress, reprimanding them and the previous administration for their failure to deal with the nationalists. At the end of his speech, he delivered a chilling bit of advice: 'It would be a great disservice to our people to let our country be swallowed whole by our mistakes.'\n\nAt the behest of Horner, Foster has begun preparing a contingency plan with Field Marshal Elba Nesby, in case the worst comes to pass."

 hadernland.17.t:0 "One Morning in [GetMonth]"
 hadernland.17.d:0 "Early in the morning, Johan Horner awoke to the sound of thunderous knocking on the door to his home. When he opened the door, Foster, surrounded by two members of the Security Comittee, spoke up: 'We have to leave at once.'\n\nMajor strategic points in Kalvar had been seized by brigades of armed members of the NRP marching through the streets near all government buildings, intent on arresting Horner. The city's garrison had been ordered to surrender by General Karl Gard at the very beginning of the attack in hopes of ousting the socialist government. Many of the Federal Congress representatives, along with the Chairman and his cabinet, managed to escape north to Oslen with the help of the worker's militias. With similiar marches happening in many major cities of the south, the country has fallen into dissarray.\n\nThat evening, Auden Haestad, one of the few remaining representatives of the Federal Congress in Kalvar, ceded power to the voulgerists in a radio broadcast addressing the nation.

They have informed us that they have learned the travel schedule of General Secretary Foster in the Union of Hadernland, owing to the help of an anonymous member within the Federal Congress, and have asked us to sponsor an attack. Stretched thin, they have requested the arms needed for the assassination to take place. If the Workers' International found out about this, it could drastically worsen our relations. Should we accept their request?"

 hadernland.27.t:0 "A Trip to Nordenkomber"
 hadernland.27.d:0 "'When does it stop raining around here?' Katja's head rested against the cold glass of the window, watching the colorful houses that contrasted the grey sky rush by the foggy window. Despite all she'd done to adjust to her new life in Haelland, it was still unmistakable that she was tailor-made for the south.\n  'It doesn't.' Leah snickered at her own joke.\n  Unfortunately, the rest of the day was destined to be offensively drab. Not just the weather, either. The motorcade of cars, lead by members of congress and the army, were headed to Nordenkomber to inspect a new garrison of militia called up by the city to guard Oslen's northern flank. Meddling in the affairs of the army, simply put, was not Leah's cup of tea. She would much rather fight for syndicalism the way she knew how - with words and a pen. And yet, neither of those won wars.\n  Leah found herself alone with her thoughts, with Katja having drifted off to sleep in her seat. The woman must have not had a good night's sleep in a week. Leah was growing quite tired of telling her to loosen up and take real rest.\n  The motorcade came to an abrupt stop; the car at the front must have slammed its breaks.\n  Katja jolted awake and wiped her bleary eyes. 'We there?'\n  Leah craned her neck to see a truck down the road racing towards the front of the motorocade.\n  A blast ahead cut through the silence. The truck had hit a military car at the front and exploded, with the flames towering above the convoy. It had to be a bomb.\n  'Get us out of here!' Katja, shocked out of her daze, alerted the driver. Before the driver's foot hit the gas peddle, gunfire peppered the windshield. Without thinking, Leah threw herself down onto the seat as broken glass shattered onto them. The driver was hit, with his head collapsing onto the steering wheel.\n  The shooting came to an end as abruptly as it began after 30 seconds of sustained barrage, and she carefully pried open her door."

 hadernland.50.t:0 "Our Martyred Dead"
 hadernland.50.d:0 "The street, crowded by a thick smoke, filled Leah's every rushed, shallow breath with the smell and taste of gunpowder and burning gasoline. Leah reached towards the front seat and into the glove compartment, pulling out a carefully hidden pistol. Trying not to catch a glimpse of the lifeless driver, she crawled off of her seat and halfway out the door, keeping her head below the window. Her heartbeat raced as if it would explode out of her chest, and a painful ringing in her ears disoriented her. And though her thoughts were panicked, she knew clearly that whatever fate awaited her outside that car may damn well be better than inside.\n\n 'Get back in here!' Katja shouted from her seat.\n\n 'My god, where are they?' Leah muttered, peering ahead with her pistol stiffly pointed at the bewildering sight before her. A dead policeman was strewn out across the ground only meters away, with a pool of blood forming beneath him. The few cars left mostly in one piece had their windows shattered and doors riddled with holes, with not a peep from inside. She paused, listening and desperately hoping for any sound from any of them. Nothing. No promises that any of them were still breathing.\n\n 'Did you hear me? What if they're still out there!?'\n\n 'Keep quiet!' Leah could see the gunmen now. Three of them, going from car to car and peering in the windows, guns drawn. There was no use hiding. A lump formed in Leah's throat as she narrowed her aim on one of them; he looked to be a large fellow with a dark, thick mustache, and the eyes of a hungry wolf looking for his next meal.\n\nA few cars ahead, an outcry comes from within, silenced as the large gunman opens fire into the window. Leah winced. Finally, one of the shooters clamored, pointing to her."

 hadernland.50.b:0 "Leah is shot dead."

 hadernland.51.t:0 "The Deepest Red"
 hadernland.51.d:0 "One of the gunmen must have been dead on the spot when Leah pulled the trigger. She dove backwards into the car as pops, bangs, and rattles went off all around her. Katja shrieked, hugging the seat. Leah fired a few more times; though this time not as lucky.\n\n Leah was ready to peer up again, gun drawn, when she was struck in the shoulder. She quickly fired a few more times in desperation, with the last pull of the trigger only yielding an audible click. She fell back against the seat with a striking pain in her arm. She couldn't even muster the strength to aim her gun anymore. Not that it mattered. \n\nThis was the end, wasn't it? Leah could hardly imagine worse ways to go. Katja crawled over, pulling her in further. Leah grimaced, grabbing her wounded arm. It burned. Was it suppose to burn?\n\n 'Sorry, deary. I gave it my best.' Leah said.\n\nShe tossed the gun, and as she could feel her own consciousness slip away, a symphony of sirens began wailing throughout the street as what must have been dozens of cars pulled up."

 hadernland.21.t:0 "Education Revolution" ###TODO This could have better writing
 hadernland.21.d:0 "Before the initial syndicalist revolution, Academia was a nurturing ground of many revolutionaries and trade unionists. Though, it wasn't until after the revolution in 1922 when higher education became more available to the workers. And still, after the revolution, the education system itself was left without much needed reforms. Primary and Secondary schools, once part of a system to produce obedient workers, corrupt capitalists, and ruthless politicians, became a breeding ground of reactionaries in the new syndicalist Hadernland.\n\nJohan Horner, formerly a professor at the University of Oslen, had seen the problems inherent in the education system first-hand.\n\n"When educators don't properly satisfy a student's pursuit of knowledge and truth, they may become prone to look for it elsewhere. It is at that stage where propaganda has already succeeded in twisting the mind." Horner said before Congress ahead of his education reform proposals. General Secretary Foster then took the podium to eagerly endorse the Chairman's reforms, which she had a hand in drafting. After a short vote, the reforms were then handed to the Secretary of Education."

 hadernland.22.d:0 "Within the ranks of our army and civilians alike have been experiencing minor food shortages. The north's reliance on the agriculture of the south has quickly been determined to be the reason for this. The effects of the civil war have begun to to be felt all over the country, one way or another.\n\nNow, there is a dificult decision the chairman must make: Result to rationing food for the people, or cut back on army food supplies. Though, the irony of the situation has not been lost on the Federal Congress, which came to power after a strike protesting the infamous rationing act. So if we resort to rationing, let's hope we're careful..."

 hadernland.23.d:0 "Leah wilted into her chair, barely able to bring herself to reach across the desk for the day's papers; an unrelenting dread twisting her stomach into knots. The color had drained from her face the second she saw the headline again. She'd read the whole thing, top to bottom, what must have been three times. She crumpled and tossed the retched paper across the desk. Her life was over.\n\nHer rhythmically tapping fingers were interrupted by the thundering knocks on her door. Sauntering towards her entryway, she could feel her heartbeat in her throat. As soon as she saw Katja through the doorhole, she opened it right away.\n\n"You're not suppose to be here." She said as she pulled Katja inside and out of sight.\n\n"It doesn't matter. They already know about us. I rushed over as soon as I saw it in the papers." Katja gently took hold of Leah's hand. After an hour of dread and worry - wondering if they should have been more careful - Leah finally broke down at the sound of Katja's sweet voice.\n\n"What are we gonna do?" Leah whimpered, tears welling up in her eyes. "What if we can't stay together?"\n\nKatja wrapped her arms tightly around Leah. "I'm so sorry. This is all my fault." ###I should be the one to say something - this is all my fault." Katja whimpered.\n\nTears welled up in Leah's eyes as she wrapped her arms tightly around her.

Dubbed the 'red terror' by our enemies abroad, they have used these leaked reports in their propaganda efforts against us.\n\nHorner has suspicions that the abuses, mostly from FVP-aligned Red Guards, were aided in an attempted cover-up by the FVP in the congress. The implicated officers have all been arrested or discharged from duty, but this will be in the minds of our populace for some time to come."

She dove against the wall, her eyes searching the room for her gun, or an intruder, and looked out onto the counter. Her cat had knocked over a glass. She sighed, got to her feet, picked up the cat, and placed him onto the floor.\n\nAfter cleaning the mess, she sat back into her chair. A jitter in her hand made her further attempts to write futile. She breathed deeply, winced in pain at the ache of her dressed, wounded shoulder, and headed to bed."

She arrived without issue, having been greeted by members of the socialist congress at the airport, and stayed overnight at one of the hotels to meet the president the next day. Though she did lightly criticize the extravagence of her stay, she also later noted that she was very impressed by president Donelo, going on to say that he has made incredible strides towards gender, racial, and class equality in Batvia.\n\nUpon her return to Hadernland, she was said to have advised chairman Horner not to forget about our comrades in the west."

Besides a few remarks lightly criticizing the extravagence of her stay in the capital, once she met the president, she seemed immediately impressed.

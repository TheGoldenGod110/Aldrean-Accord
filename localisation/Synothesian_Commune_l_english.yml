 syncom.1.t:0 "The Fires of Revolution"
 syncom.1.d:0 "Synothese was in a dire situation duringht Aldrean War, with Batvian companies plundering the economy and exploiting the people. Destitute working conditions brought the rise of socialism, with industrial sabotage and riots in the streets becoming a profoundly common occurrence.\n\nThe final straw came when, in february of 1934, a police crackdown on striking miners lead to a bloodbath. Quickly igniting the spark of revolution across the country, the poor and damned rose up against their capitalist masters. What ensued was a bloody civil war that left the country paralyzed by death and destruction, until -in late 1935- a ceasefire was signed, granting the newfound anarchist territory the vast majority of Synothese.\n\nIn the aftermath of the treaty, the commune will now have to rebuild the nation and protect the revolution."
 syncom.1.a:0 "Workers, throw off your shackles!"

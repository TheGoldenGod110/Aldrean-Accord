This ideology tends to be militaristic and autocratic in nature, and is usually openly hostile to other, more libertarian forms of socialism.

Radical Materialists align themselves with socialism not because of moralistic reasons, but rather they see it as a scientific necessity. While similiar to the vanguardists, radical materialism is not entirely incompatable with more democratic institutions, with Radical Materialists insisting that what they strive for is more democratic than Liberal democracies."

The head of this state is normally a monarchical or clerical figure who excercises complete control over the religious affairs of the government and people, and may be praised as a prophet of sorts."

 voulgerism_noun:0 "Voulgerism"
 voulgerism_desc:0 "Voulgerist"
 voulgerism_subtype:0 "Voulgerist"
 voulgerism_subtype_desc:0 "Voulgerism is a revolutionary ideology tracing its origins back to the 'Voulger' movement ('Voulger' being the Bevaranian word for vulgar, meaning belonging to the masses.) beginning in the late 19th century. The uprising, comprising both the working and capitalist class, was a response to the radical conservatism and perceived tyranny of the Bevaranian monarchy. The leading thinkers of the movement, initially receptive to socialism and particularly early holmarist ideas, attempted to guide the movement in the direction of radical labourism. After much splintering owing to a divide between the capitalist and labour wing of the movement and state repression, the uprising eventually failed. That wasn't the end of the social movement behind it, though. One of the remaining lead thinkers of the Voulger movement, William Vasseur, abandoned his initial ideas of a worker-lead class struggle, instead theorizing that that similiar movements in the future must emphasize collaboration between the classes and a shared nationalistic spirit, which he believed was key to uniting the people against the monarchy once again. A radical modernist and nationalist, he saw the monarchy and religious clergy as holding the nation and its people back, supposedly evidenced by the former uprising. In 1910, Vasseur published 'La Solution Moderne', a book outlining a supposed complete restructuring of society, around corporatist, nationalist, and modernist principles. This later became known as the foundation of future Voulgerist movements. Modern Voulgerist tendencies follow the theoretical works of Vasseur, and call for a revolutionary overthrow of their ruling state, or 'a violent rejection of tradition' to create a new republic. While specific movements within the ideology may tend to contradict eachother occasionally, they have become mostly united in a nationalistic spirit. Now strongly opposed to both liberalism and socialism as well, they insist that they reject conventional politics."
